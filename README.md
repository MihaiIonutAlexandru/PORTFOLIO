## <a name="aboutme">:mag_right: ABOUT ME</a>

<p align="justify">I'm a 32 years old Welding / Heat Treatment Technician who decided it is time for a transformative shift! My desire for continuous learning and new challenges, led me to seek a profession that would allow me constantly self-develop and use my talent for error detection. This decision will mark a pivotal moment in my life as I transition to the role of a software tester.

With over a decade of experience in the industrial field, I have accumulated discipline, punctuality, and strong teamwork skills. My current role emphasizes time management, efficiency, and accuracy in completing tasks under tight deadlines. Working on industrial projects has honed my ability to handle complex details with ease. I've improved interpersonal skills through teamwork, learning effective cooperation and communication.

Pursuing a role as a Quality Assurance Engineer / Software Tester, I offer a disciplined work ethic, teamwork appreciation, and newly acquired skills from a QA Engineer course. My goal is to get a job in a reputed company where I can use my skills and knowledge to deliver good results in the long term. I am enthusiastic about applying my previous interpersonal and newly acquired skills within a forward-thinking company to scale up the organization's production and growth rate and at the same time for my personal career growth as well.

I have completed the QA Manual Engineer course at the IT school GoIT and got relevant knowledge. I know how to work with testing documentation such as: test-plan, test-strategy, test-case, bug-reports and other kinds of documentation. I have experience in Jira, Trello, Postman, Testrail, Dbeaver and SQL. I have tested some web-applications and taken part in a successful cross functional team project.</p>
